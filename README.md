Global warming polynomial regression algorithm 

Global warming is an issue that affect us all, since all mankind live in this one single planet. Since several decades ago we are well aware that GW is real and continous to worsen. Nowadays one of the main challenges is to understand the rising of temperature around the world, in order to create acurate solutions, policies and foresee and possibly prevent the effects of such event. 

Prediction the behavior of globar warming is no trivial task, since according to historical records, the temperature of the Earth's surface has been increasing in a non-linear trend as seen in the following graph.

While it is easy to understand that in the new future the temperature will keep increasing, is pretty hard to say with accuracy what is the temperature offset by certain year, it is not a linear behavior. Therefore a polynomial regression model seems accurate to try to predict the increase in temperature with more accuracy. 

By using sklearn framewrok which allows to do polynomial regressions in an easy and understandable way, it is possible to model the behavior of this phenomena which in turn would allow to predict for years which haven't been recorded and thus take measures that allow us to reduce GW effects.
